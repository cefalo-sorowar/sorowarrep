The Anti-Corruption Commission says it has brought back around 20.41 lakh Singapore dollars laundered by BNP Chairperson Khaleda Zia’s younger son Arafat Rahman Koko and his associate.

"A few minutes back, I came to know that the sum of money has been transferred to Sonali Bank's Ramna corporate branch from Singapore," ACC Chairman Ghulam Rahman around 5:00pm yesterday said.

The commission earlier had opened the Stolen Asset Recovery Account to receive the amount, he told reporters while leaving his office in the capital’s Segunbagicha.

The money, equivalent to over Tk 13 crore, was deposited in Singapore by Koko and Ismail Hossain Saimon, son of former BNP minister late Akbar Hossain. It will be now spent in anti-graft activities, he said.

This is the first money laundering case in which the government could recover an amount.

ACC Deputy Director Abu Syeed on March 17, 2009 sued Koko and Saimon for laundering more than Tk 20 crore -- Singapore $28,84,603.15 and US $9,32,672.81.

Koko had received the amount from the Chinese company Siemens and from Habibur Rahman, a Bangladeshi living in Dubai, Syeed told The Daily Star over phone yesterday.

The anti-graft body recovered the amount that Habib had sent to Fairhill Consulting’s account at Singapore Overseas Bank from Janata Bank's Dubai branch between 2004 and 2007.
